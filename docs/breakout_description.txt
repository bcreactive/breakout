description:

use left/right arrow-keys to launch the ball and control the platform.
try to save the ball and hit the bricks, until all of them disappear to reach the next level!

there are different brick-colors, depending on the amount of healtpoints a brick has.

collectibles will spawn randomly if blocks are destroyed and need to be fetched with the platform to take effect:

-temporary increase of the platform-width
-temporary increase of damagepoints
-multiball
-extra life

a timer indicates the remaining time of the temporary effects.
